An issue that we had state in the preliminary is that we had not finished the Employee Stats screen. There was no functionality and it was all static data. We decided to delete the Employee Stats screen completely and instead add an Employee Stats button in the Employee Management table in the Employee Management screen. Each employee had a respective stats button, that when clicked, spawned a modal with that employees stats for the jumps and weeks for the week, month, and year.

Another resolved issue was how we couldn't get dropdowns to be editable after pulling default selected value from db table. However, we noticed that this would just be used currently in Inventory and in this instance there are only 2 options (is rented or is NOT rented). Therefore, the best design feature here would be to just have an editable checkbox that pulls the default value from the db table, whether or not to be checked/unchecked. This was implemented and works great!

Final issue resolved was Adding and Deleting an item in Inventory. This was buggy and not very clean code at the time of the preliminary submission. Now, there is a clean way to do both elegantly. For adding, you can select from a dropdown the item type and the view will change in the right (as opposed to 4 different buttons to add each item type). For deleting and item, this feature wasn't fully complete, mainly due to wanting to have adding an item completely functioning. Otherwise, it would be very troublesome to have to add item into the MySql db manually and hold on relationships and maintain data integrity (i.e. for adding an item of Container: would need to insert in items, and containers table). Delete an item will show in "real time", meaning it will delete from the table view on the left side of the screen, similarly to how adding and editing item do it (as long as it successfully made the change in the db).
