An issue that we had state in the preliminary is that we had not finished the Employee Stats screen. There was no functionality and it was all static data. We decided to delete the Employee Stats screen completely and instead add an Employee Stats button in the Employee Management table in the Employee Management screen. Each employee had a respective stats button, that when clicked, spawned a modal with that employees stats for the jumps and weeks for the week, month, and year.
