An issue that was resolved early on in our development phase was getting a working table in React. We began by creating a React table component that was flexible, but it ended up not being as great as we wanted. After searching for an alternative solution, we stumbled upon the React-Table library online and added it to our project. We have used React-Table across our entire project.

Another issue that we ran into on the frontend was getting two components to transfer data between each other. Since React has hierarchical data flow (moving vertically down and back up), we had to solve this issue by wrapping the two components in a parent class so that the data could flow through the parent class to each other rather than one component to the other.

Another issue that we had on the frontend was getting data to from our database to populate textfeilds, checkboxes, and dropdowns, then being able to edit that data and save the updated feilds in our database . To fix this we had to pass in the data from the database through the components props and then save them in states. This enabled us to populate and edit the textfeilds, checkboxes, and dropdowns as well as update our database with the new feilds.
