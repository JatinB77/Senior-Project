Paul Bayruns
CONTRIBUTIONS
===================
GENERAL
-Offered consistent support and advice to other members for overall project design, development environment setup, and ultimately
served as a resource available to any team member at any time I could be.
-Communicated and made myself available extensively on slack, jumping into discussions of any issues that I had advice to offer.
--->As a result, I ended up sending ~2,700 out of the ~6,000 total slack messages for our team.
-Attended every project meeting that occured for the full meeting duration, including occasional long meetings on weekends.
-Met with other team members independently when needed.
-Helped keep meetings focused and keep project on track with members leaving meetings knowing what was to be done next.
-Spearheaded unraveling of frontend frameworks and best practices. Took initiative to complete the full Codecademy for React and subsequently 
investigated best practices, library weaknesses to avoid, and design priniciples, including dozens of articles and several 30+ minute conference talks from Facebook.
--->Ultimately, this made using React and the associated libraries easier for the rest of the team as I setup the project structure and
became a resource for React questions.
-As the project progressed, began to work on the backend (in addition to the frontend) when it had more overall work needed and became a bottleneck.
--->In doing so, I gained a full understanding of the project's full tech stack. There are no files in this project that I have not reviewed
or do not understand.

ARTIFACTS
-Wrote portions of specification.
-Revised and reviewed all portions of specification.
-Wrote sections of design doc.
-Revised and reviewed most sections of the design doc.
-Helped in updating all artifacts when needed.

REACT/FRONTEND
-Sought out libraries to solve team problems. 
--->Investigated different library options.
--->Read library documentation and created first usage examples for other team members to go off of.
--->In some cases, created custom handling of library usage cases in reusable components to abstract and make library usage easier 
(such as wrapping library components in custom components or utility classes). 
--->Libraries found, figured out, and implemented: reactstrap, react-router, react-table, react-toastify, react-big-calender, moment.js
--->Created utility solutions for both handling requests and binding class methods in requestHandler.js and binder.js respectively.
--->Helped extensively in managing team usage of Node Package Manager, often spending nontrivial amounts of time helping other team members get their setups working.

-Created full user interface sections of the application
--->Created the entirety of both the Signout/Rigsheet screen and the Loft/Problem queue screen (including all reusable components made for these that were used application-wide)
--->Created the Landing page, 404 page, navbar, main menu, and the unused login, password reset, and account creation screens

-Created crucial reusable component sections, along with first examples for other team members to use:
--->All dropdowns except FilterDropdown
--->All lists
--->The base ModalButton and ModalDialog components and all implementations of them except the stat and employee buttons
--->Created reusable tab group component
--->Created the TableSheet component and used it for Rigsheet, which served as an example
--->Created most of if not all of the frontend of the prototype, giving team members an example of a full functioning React
screen component to use as a start for theirs.
-Helped team members with their portions of the application
--->Had several multiple hour calls with Jatin over Thanksgiving break assisting in the implementation of the inventory screen.
--->Refactored the inventory screen and its subcomponents, cutting out over 2,000 lines of code while maintaining the same functionality.
--->Met with Andres many times to work on the project outside of meeting times and helped in implementation of the employee screen.
--->Reviewed rental screen code with Brian and helped solve problems interacting with endpoints on the rental screen.

DJANGO/DATABASE
-Helped design overall database over several meetings including actively making arguments for or against DB design decisions
-Helped Paul T and Jon debug Django issues
-Figured out how to modify Django setup to serve our react files for production
-Wrote backend functions for adding and editing for each type of inventory item.
-Made edits to fix models when code from other members would accidentally cause django to throw errors and not run the server.
-Helped research and attempt to implement solutions to authentication problems encountered later in the application. 

AWS/HOSTING
-Responsible for AWS hosting of the application
-Got application live on EC2 instance after significant difficulties in deploying
-Researched advice, best practices, and tutorials to get React and Django to work together to make backend able to actually serve frontend files 
(Dev environment hosts frontend on one port, which makes requests to backend running on different port)
-Managed our RDS instances, ensuring they were working and configured properly. 
-Quickly restored RDS database from generated backup when entire schema was accidentally dropped
